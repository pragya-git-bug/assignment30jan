Local Variables:

Declared within a method, constructor, or block of code.
Limited to the block or method in which they are declared.
Not accessible outside the method, constructor, or block.
Instance Variables:

Declared within a class but outside any method, constructor, or block.
Associated with an instance of the class (object).
Accessible throughout the entire class and can be accessed using an object of the class.

Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have multiple methods having the same name but with different parameters. In other words, two or more methods in the same class can have the same name, but they must differ in the type or number of their parameters.
